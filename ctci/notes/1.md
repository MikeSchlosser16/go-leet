## Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

#### Hash Tables
Data structure that maps key to value for efficient lookup


#### ArrayList & Resizable arrays
- Some languages arrays are autoresizable, some not. 
- Java, for example, not. Need arrayList for this purpose. Same with go, need slice.
- Typical implementation of arrayList is that when array is full, array doubles in size. 
```
ArrayList<String> merge(String[] words, String[] more) {
ArrayList<String> sentence = new ArrayList<String>();
for (String w : words) sentence.add(w);
for (String w : more) sentence.add(w);
return sentence;
```
- Each insertion is O(1) average, even though some take O(N) on a resize

#### StringBuilder
- In java, strings immutable
- StringBuilder avoids copying string problem. It creates a resizable aray of all strings, then copies them back to 1 string only when necessary
